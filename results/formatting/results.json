For example, SPF 30 filters out about 96.7% of UVB rays, while SPF 50 filters out about 98.5%.\n3. **Consider the type of sunscreen**: There are two main types: chemical sunscreens and physical sunscreens. Chemical sunscreens work by absorbing UV rays, while physical sunscreens work by creating a physical barrier on the skin's surface.\n4. **Think about your skin type and needs**: If you have sensitive skin, you may want to look for a sunscreen that is labeled as \"hypoallergenic\" or \"fragrance-free.\" If you have dry skin, you may want to look for a moisturizing sunscreen.\n\n**Using Sunscreen Effectively:**\n\n1. **Apply sunscreen liberally**:",

Mineral sunscreens work by sitting on the surface of the skin and physically blocking the sun's rays, while chemical sunscreens work by being absorbed into the skin and scattering the sun's rays. Mineral sunscreens are generally considered to be safer and more effective, but they can be more difficult to apply and can cause a certain amount of aesthetic concern.\n\n4. be sure to apply the sunscreen correctly.
